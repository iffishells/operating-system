Security and Protection :
    There are two types of Security;
    1   :  Network Security
    2   :  System Security

    System Security have tow main things .One of Authorization and Malware stuff.In Security which is policy
    prevention of unauthorized Access to a system.for example Malicious Code and Accidental Access .Access may
    be the some execution the code and read information which is private etc 
    our main goal in Security and Protection is secure the Data .i Will secure tha Data using some more concept
    
    .Authentication and confidentiality and integrity and Availabilty .We give the handle to the user at least 
    he Perform the operation .Actually User interact with the Process .Authentication is that WHo will do that.
    Integrity mean that verify the Data not be compromize like modify and update and added.confidentiality Not Everyone 
    access the Data unless allow it .Availbility mean that who can do this.Who can access the system.

Access control Matrix/list:
    Access control Matrix in which we save the Module. In the column we adds the object and the row we add the
    Domain.

    D0 = [Ali , usman]
    D1 = [Farooq]

    F0 = [Desktop ,Documents]
    f1 = [/var]
    
        f0          f1          Printer   
    D0  read        read-write  print
    D1  write       read                
    D2  execute     
    This is Access control matrix we set the subject and object and their right . In Here we can change the domain 
    form High priority to low priority but not reversible.for example HOD Change into the instructor but instructor 
    not change into the HOD.But most of the ACL access control list in which we define column wise.Because create 
    the single table is im-practicle 
    
Password Management ,Hashes and salt:
    We usually save the password in the plain text type which is very bad for Security.if Hacker some how he Hack
    the file where you save the password then he hack it. But in order to gain the Security for our Password
    Management we use the Hash function which our password go through this function and encrypt into other form
    if Someone hack your Password then he not be able to predict the real function.But we not use the mod function 
    for Hashing Because by using mod we can predict the inputs form the output .
    
    So we need like function which is not reversible that is SHA256 which is not reversible if someone Hacked it
    then he will never predict real input. in Order to seek more Security we add some valid Number in the Hash For 
    the Security.how the function compute the Hash this is Abstraction
