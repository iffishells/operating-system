Paging :
    After the segmentation concept in which memory management How memory allocate in the
    Ram at the running time .But there are some problem.Then we achieved the Paging concept
    in which we split the data logically not physically.Due to paging we get many benefits like 
    protection ,cache Coherence ,etc

**Protection**:
    With the help of Paging we got the Protection from the Malware virus ,malicious codes.
    Actually malicious code work like when the function call goes into the stack and allocate 
    the space of local variable in some how malicious code keep in the place of local variable
    and write the address of this local variable on the function return call then execute the 
    malicious code then with the help of paging "we allow the only to write the malicious code
    not the execute that code.

Sharing:
    with help of paging we share the data as virtual memory.virtual memory makes the memory
    sharing easily.we don't need to inter process communication.

swap Spaces:
    In demand page in which page table frame which store in the cache which is very fast and store 
    all other data in the swap space/partition.When we need which is not in ram we take form the Swap Spaces
    and load into the memory.identify using valid and not valid Condition.

Cache Coherence:
    by using cache Coherence our work done very Quickly.by using Page Replacement policy
    we take the data form Hardware to Cache memory before we  use it.if the Data again again 
    give and take from the Hardware then its become very slow.

File System:
    file System is part of operating system which is responsible for storing the Data 
    and retrieving the data form.For example if we save the file.txt then os will handle
    and where it save and how it save which is abstraction save it somewhere on the Hardware
    Everything use in this process is called file system.Different OS has Different file system
    like WINDOW fat32 , NTFS , ext4 etc
    
    File system has also interact with Block stream device which is has no concept of Addressing
    like Network Card Printer etc

virtual File System:
    virtual file system generally is a layer which is sit on the of your actual file System 
    which allow the user to access different type of file system .In the linux __proc__ is
    the Virtual file system which access the user to access different file system 

Benefits and Importance:
    Every device has own design for the os very Difficult to handle all the design 
    so with help of virtual file system we only need to check and update the
    file system instead of All.VFs provide us Abstraction for the MetaData caching
    ,permission check which benefits disk base file system.
